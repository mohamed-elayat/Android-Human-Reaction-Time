## About

One of the projects for our User Interface class. After starting the game, the game displays a yellow screen
 after a random number of milliseconds between 3000 and 10,000.
The user must click on the screen as soon as the screen turns yellow. After a series of 5 trials,
 the game shows the user his average reaction time.


## Running the app

Android Studio needs to be installed to run the app. To run the app from Android Studio, do the following: 

1. Create new project and wait for it to build (File -> New -> New Project -> Next,Next,Next... Finish)
2. Open windows explorer 
3. Go into the app folder location of the new project (My Application\app\)  
	(The path can be found on the title bar of the window)
		
3. Delete the src folder  

Then,  

4. Download the archive from GitHub  
5. Copy the src folder from the archive and paste it in the project location (to replace the src folder you deleted)  

From Android Studio,  

6. Click on Run -> Run (or press Shift + F10).  
7. Either connect an Android phone to run it on, or download an emulator. (Might take a few minutes to build)
